While working on "quest icons", I started playing around with color palettes that demonstrate the setting of the quest. The next few images are quests found in the *Haunted Forest*
## Concept Art
### The Boy
Meet the main character! After a bad *bring your kid to work* day, he finds himself in an upside-down world, where monsters try to hunt him and his family down as he saves his grandpa's business. Maybe his old friends could help?

### Roy, Gee, and Biv
These gnome-like creatures are found in the *Haunted Forest*. They **LOVE** to sell colorful and *very* explosive things.

### Nasty Habit
Poor little Nico. He's just a little guy that has a nasty habit. It all started with his obcession with the smell of sulfur, now he can stop!

### The Pharmacist
Gilbert roams the alley ways of the *Haunted Forest* selling terrible, nasty habits to little ghosts. Plus, he has a nice cake.
