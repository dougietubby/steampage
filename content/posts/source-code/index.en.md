## This Place Looks Weird?
You’ve stumbled on my new site! Sorry it looks unfinished :(fas fa-face-sad-tear fa-fw):. I’m avoiding *easy* site builders because they limit creativity. In short, I taught myself *HTML* and *CSS* in 2 months to create a unique experience for you! 

    Many of these free site builders have fees for easy to add features, but... 
    I'm broke. 

I'm tired of every indie developer websites acting as a landing page, just to send you to other websites to buy their games. **I want to make this website a part of the *experience* as much as I can.** I want to use gifs for backgrounds, embed games into every corner of the page, and sell some products without these extra fees. **Plus I can post anything I want, all in one spot!**
