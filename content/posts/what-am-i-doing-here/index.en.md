This isn’t an ordinary landing page. You can find EVERYTHING I’ve made here. I’ll be treating [Dougie.Cool](https://dougie.cool) as if it were my own desktop, where small games, character art, and videos are regularly posted.

## This Place Looks Weird?
Hey there! Welcome to my new site! Sorry it's not fully polished yet, but hey, that's part of the fun, right? I decided to skip the easy site builders because I don’t want your visit to be too cookie cutter. Also, those free site builders might offer cool stuff, but they always come with a price tag, and right now, I'm on a tight budget. I spent a good couple of months learning HTML and CSS to make something special just for you!

Sick of indie devs' sites just being glorified ads? Me too. I want this site to be an experience in itself. Think GIFs as backgrounds, games hidden in every nook, and selling stuff without those annoying fees. And the best part? I can post whatever I want, all in one spot!

{{< admonition quote "TLDR">}}


Many of these free site builders have fees for easy to add features, but... 
I'm broke.
