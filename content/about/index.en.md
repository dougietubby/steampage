## Hello!
{{< admonition warning "Just so you know"> false }}
I'm Dougie, a solo developer based in OHIO. Yeah, I know.

### What do I do
I've been learning [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) since 2015, but still haven't had the perseverance to finish posting a game publically. I’ll be posting games and tutorials here for you too! With all the music, games, and art found on the site, I’m sure you’ll enjoy your stay.

### Wishlist Here!
Currently, my game Phasmonauts is [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2654210/Phasmonauts/) [![Wishlist](/images/Phasmonauts-title.png)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2654210/Phasmonauts/)

I really enjoy pixel art with a "floppy" style and creating cozy feeling games. If you feel the same way, follow me for monthly recommendations and posts. As a game developer, I've become a jack of all trades. Music and Art will be posted here as well.
